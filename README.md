# Ozone_CloudTransmission
Total ozone and Cloud transmittance retrieved from GUV-instruments operating at the UV-network locations, and corresponding total ozone amount from TOMS/OMI overpass data.

Ozone data has been corrected for solar zenith angle (SZA) and cloud transmittance, based on a regression against long term series of OMI overpass data. Hence, the ozone data reflects the absolute calibration scale of the OMI instrument.

Files are organized with the following columns:

Year
Daynumber
SZA: The solar zenith angle at nooon

GUV_Ozone: Total ozone based on GUV-instrument

GUV_CLT: Cloud transmittance at noon

Ozone TOMS/OMI: Total ozone overpass data from TOMS and OMI

GUV-Serialnumber: The serial number of the GUV-541/511 instrument operating at the location

Missing data is indicated with NAN.
